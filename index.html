					<h3>A brief history of me</h3>
					<p>
						As I went through school like many, I've been drawn to the world's mechanics – mathematics, physics, ... and computer science. <br/>
						I figured that I should either become a science teacher or a computer scientist. Back in 2003, I found myself studying <strong>software engineering</strong> at the HPI; at which I excelled and have been awarded best of class receiving my <strong>master's degree</strong> in 2009.
					</p>
					<p>					
						Five years on, I have pursued the technological area of <strong>business process management</strong> further. 
						As a lecturer enjoy sharing my knowledge with students. As a researcher, I stay curious and challenge myself with behavioral analytics. 
						In my <strong>dissertation</strong>, I developed a search engine for process models.<br/>

				<p>
					In process choreographies, where business processes of different participants interact, monitoring and performance analysis is difficult, as delays may occur by waiting for certain responses. <br/> To correctly monitor service level agreements of a health insurance company, we developed the <a href="dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-37804-1_23"><span class="lnk">foundations</span></a> to support the monitoring processes interactions, particularly if only few events can be detected.

					Business process models cater the understanding of how organizations carry out their operations. However, they can also assist in controlling these operations, if they are orchestrated by software. <br/>
